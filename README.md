# Testoracle

## Abstract
When a piece of code passes a test, it can mean that the code is ready for production or that a student has passed an exam or that an interview has been passed successfully or that for that the 4-color theorem in graph theory has been proven or that a coding competition has found its winner. All these events are important for many potential blockchain applications.

## Information
In this project we would like to write a basic smart contract that integrates a chain-link oracle about the status of a testing-script. We will use a basic hardhat environment and a simple UI for proof of concept until the submission deadline.
